COMP2673 Assignment <assignumber> : In this assignment, you will have to <create> a <type> <datastructure> that can store <data> and perform <function> functions on each element.  It utilizes the <type> <datastructure> ADT that you <created> back in assignment <assignumber2> .  You will have to <do> your own <check> checking.  A <quality> test program is included to help you <kill> any bugs you might have.  <as-you-know> , this assignment is very <hard> , so start early. Due <date> <time> .
